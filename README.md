EmoDetect - Real-time Facial Emotion Detection
EmoDetect is an advanced real-time facial emotion detection system that leverages deep learning and computer vision techniques to accurately recognize and analyze emotions from facial expressions. This project allows users to detect emotions like anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutrality in real-time using a webcam or images.

# Key Features:

**Real-time Emotion Detection**: EmoDetect provides instantaneous emotion predictions, enabling real-time emotion analysis.

**Webcam Integration: **The system seamlessly accesses the webcam, allowing users to observe their emotion detection results in real-time.

**Multi-Emotion Classification:** EmoDetect is designed to detect multiple emotions, including anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutrality.

**Graphical User Interface (GUI):** The project comes with an intuitive GUI, making it user-friendly and accessible to users of all levels.

**Model Optimization:** The emotion recognition model is optimized for performance, ensuring fast and accurate predictions on various devices.

**API Integration:** EmoDetect offers an API that accepts image inputs from external applications, making it easy to integrate emotion detection functionality into other projects.

**User-Friendly Output:** The results are presented using graphical elements, simplifying interpretation and understanding of emotions.

# How to Use:

Install the required dependencies listed in the "requirements.txt" file.

Run the main application file, which initializes the real-time emotion detection process.

Allow EmoDetect to access your webcam to enable real-time emotion detection.

Observe the emotions detected from your facial expressions displayed on the GUI.

# Technologies Used:

Python
TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning model)
OpenCV (for image processing and face detection)
FastAPI (for serving the model as an API)
Flask (for creating the local server to run the API)

# Future Enhancements:

**Voice Emotion Detection**: Incorporate speech analysis to detect emotions based on the user's voice input.

**Emotion History Tracking:** Implement a feature that allows users to track their emotions over time, providing valuable insights for self-awareness and emotional management.

**Facial Landmark Visualization:** Display facial landmarks on the detected faces to visualize the areas of the face used for emotion classification.

**Cross-Platform Support:** Extend EmoDetect's compatibility to other platforms like iOS and web browsers.

**Emotion Recognition from Video Streams:** Expand the application to recognize emotions from live video streams.

**Emotion Intensity Levels:** Enhance the model to predict emotion intensity levels for more nuanced emotion analysis.
